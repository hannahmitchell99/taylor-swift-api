# taylor-swift-api

This work in progress is my fullstack project for nology, my crowning glory, and a celebration of the trailblazer Taylor Swift!

Using Springboot, Java, MySQL and React, I was able to create this API and basic (but cute!) front-end.

I have a few things I want to add to this project, so watch this space!
