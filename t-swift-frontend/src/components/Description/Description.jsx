Beginning as a young country artist in the mid-2000s, Swift often wore cowboy boots, sundresses, and curly hair to complement her music's country sound.

She also began wearing her hair in a sleek, straight style, which became her signature look for several years. <br/>

She began incorporating more leather, metallics, and rock-inspired accessories into her outfits, which complemented the sound of her music during this time. <br/>
                <br/>In recent years, Swift's style has become more playful and colorful, often incorporating bold prints and bright hues. She has also experimented with more eclectic, bohemian-inspired looks, including oversized sunglasses, flowy dresses, and statement jewelry.
